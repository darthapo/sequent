== Sequent

Sequent is an easy to use web-comic publishing tool. It supports:

* Strip archives
* News posts
* Content pages
* Themes
* RSS feeds
* Custom assets: Wallpaper, Avatar, Strip -- each will automatically create thumbnails/versions of different sizes based on type.
* Caching of pages for better performance
* Everything is commentable


=== Requirements

* Ruby on Rails
* Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)
* ImageMagick


=== Installation

First, copy the config/database.example.yml to config/database.yml and update it to point to your database(s). Then, from your installation's root directory, you need to run:

  rake app:setup

It will setup the database, default admin user, and more. After it's done just start your webserver and browse to http://localhost:3000/admin and start publishing your web-comic!


=== TODO

* Storyline support


=== IDEAS

* Strip preview support (Prototype Image Cropper)
* Strip tagging
* Support breaking pages into panels for iPod/PSP support?
* Cache pages with a slug of 404 and 500 -- therefore supporting theme'd error pages
* Reordering/Grouping of pages in CMS. It would just be for organization, they would all still be accessible via the URI: /pages/PAGE_NAME
* Forums? Integrate Beast( beast.caboo.se )
* Customized ad support? (a mini ad server kinda thing)
* Password protected pages? -- a) Setup passwords or users/passwords for each page, or b) allow user registrations and only allow a certain 'group' of users into the page.
* Highlight dates with comics on them in the date-picker?
* Edit themes in admin UI
* Scroll the calendar in the Strip admin section
* Improve admin layout
